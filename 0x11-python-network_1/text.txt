In this first debugging project, you will need to get Apache to run on the container and to return a page containing Hello Holberton when querying the root of it.
Example:
vagrant@vagrant:~$ docker run -p 8080:80 -d -it holbertonschool/265-0
47ca3994a4910bbc29d1d8925b1c70e1bdd799f5442040365a7cb9a0db218021
vagrant@vagrant:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
47ca3994a491        holbertonschool/265-0   "/bin/bash"         3 seconds ago       Up 2 seconds        0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   vigilant_tesla
vagrant@vagrant:~$ curl 0:8080
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
vagrant@vagrant:~$
Here we can see that after starting my Docker container, I curl the port 8080mapped to the Docker container port 80, it does not return a page but an error message. Note that you might also get the error message curl: (52) Empty reply from server.
vagrant@vagrant:~$ curl 0:8080
Hello Holberton
vagrant@vagrant:~$
After connecting to the container and fixing whatever needed to be fixed (here is your mission), you can see that curling port 80 return a page that contains Hello Holberton. Paste the command(s) you used to fix the issue in your answer file.



how do I get the container they want me to use?

Show drafts

Here's a breakdown of how to get the container, understand the task, and potential troubleshooting areas:

Getting the Container

The instructions mention a container called "holbertonschool/265-0". Here's how to obtain it:

Docker Hub:

Search for "holbertonschool/265-0" on the Docker Hub repository: https://hub.docker.com/.
If it's a public image, you'll find the command to pull it directly.
Holberton School Resources:

If this exercise is part of the Holberton School curriculum, they likely provide the container in a couple of ways:
Private Repository: You might have access to a private repository where the image is stored. Check your course materials for repository address and login credentials.
Build Instructions: They may provide a Dockerfile that outlines how to build the container image yourself.
Understanding the Task

The main goal of the exercise is to:

Run the holbertonschool/265-0 container.
Investigate why the Apache web server inside the container isn't correctly serving the "Hello Holberton" page.
Fix the configuration within the container to make Apache work as expected.
Troubleshooting Areas

Once you have the container running, consider these common areas where things might go wrong:

Apache not installed: The container might not have Apache pre-installed.
Apache not running: Apache might be installed but not started.
Apache misconfiguration: The Apache configuration file might have errors preventing it from serving the page.
Firewall: The container's internal firewall might be blocking access to port 80.
How to Proceed

Pull the container: Use the docker pull holbertonschool/265-0 command (assuming it's on Docker Hub).
Run the container: Use the provided command docker run -p 8080:80 -d -it holbertonschool/265-0
Connect to the container: Use docker exec -it <container_id> bash to get a shell inside the running container.
Start troubleshooting:
Use ps aux or similar commands to check if Apache is running.
Use systemctl start apache2 (or the appropriate command for your Linux distribution) if it's not running.
Examine the Apache configuration file (usually located at /etc/apache2/apache2.conf or a similar path).
Check firewall rules using iptables -L
